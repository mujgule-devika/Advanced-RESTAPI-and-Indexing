# RESTful API Design for Distributed Software Systems to handle any structured Data

Implemented Rest API in NodeJS that can handle any structured data in Json, validate the same and save the Json Schema in Redis. Use indexing techiques using Elastic Search to support logical operators, wildcards, geolocation, join, and aggregate queries.

## Features

• Implemented Rest API that can handle any structured data in Json using Node and Redis Storage with the ability to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.

• JSON document will be validated with the defined JSON Schema before storing it in Redis

• Secured Rest endpoints with bearer token generated by JWT

• Implemented PATCH/MERGE/UPDATE at the granular field level to update a particulate field without having to get the entire JSON document thereby saving network bandwidth.

• Involved the concept of ETags for conditional GET and PUT requests using Hashing technique.

• Utilized the REDIS queuing mechanism to enque and deque requests will full backup in a seperate queue before INDEXING the data in Elastic Search.

• Utilized Kibana Server and Sense Console for full text searching of indexed documents in Elastic Search.

### API Endpoints

(A Sample JSON Object for the plan can be found [here](https://github.com/jayashree1992/Advanced_Big_Data_Indexing/blob/master/usecase.json))

- GET `/token` - This generates a RSA-signed JWT token used to authenticate future requests.
- POST `/plan` - Creates a new plan provided in the request body
- PUT `/plan/{id}` - Updates an existing plan provided by the id
  - A valid Etag for the object should also be provided in the `If-Match` HTTP Request Header
- PATCH `/plan/{id}` - Patches an existing plan provided by the id
  - A valid Etag for the object should also be provided in the `If-Match` HTTP Request Header
- GET `/plan/{id}` - Fetches an existing plan provided by the id
  - An Etag for the object can be provided in the `If-None-Match` HTTP Request Header
  - If the request is successful, a valid Etag for the object is returned in the `ETag` HTTP Response Header
- DELETE `/plan/{id}` - Deletes an existing plan provided by the id
  - A valid Etag for the object should also be provided in the `If-Match` HTTP Request Header

### [](https://github.com/shah-tejas/BigDataIndexing#sample-queries-to-search-the-indexed-data)Sample Queries to search the indexed data:

Sample queries can be fired on the Kibana console to retrieve the indexed data

1.  Query all plans

    ```
    GET planindex/_search
    {
      "query": {
        "match_all": {}
      }
    }

    ```

2.  Query based on a nested object's objectId, alongwith the nested object

    ```
    GET planindex/_search
    {
      "query": {
        "nested": {
          "path": "linkedPlanServices.linkedService",
          "query": {
            "match": {
                  "linkedPlanServices.linkedService.objectId": "1234520xvc30asdf-502"
            }
          },
          "inner_hits": {}
        }
      }
    }

    ```

3.  Query wildcard text fields

    ```
    GET planindex/_search
    {
      "query": {
        "wildcard": {
          "_org": {
            "value": "example*"
          }
        }
      }
    }

    ```

4.  Query nested object's wildcard text fields

    ```
    GET planindex/_search
    {
      "query": {
        "nested": {
          "path": "linkedPlanServices.linkedService",
          "query": {
            "wildcard": {
              "linkedPlanServices.linkedService.name.keyword": {
                "value": "Year*"
              }
            }
          },
          "inner_hits": {}
        }
      }
    }

    ```

5.  Range query on a numeric field

    ```
    GET planindex/_search
    {
      "query": {
        "nested": {
          "path": "planCostShares",
          "query": {
            "range": {
              "planCostShares.copay": {
                "gte": 20,
                "lte": 35
              }
            }
          },
          "inner_hits": {}
        }
      }
    }
    ```
